# Removing the extra drive so Cloudbuilder can complete

Disable the HBA330 to get through the deploy and then turn it back on.

Use the SOS console to access your Metal host and get into the BIOS.  You will reboot the instance and wait for the boot screen then hit F2 to get into the BIOS.  Go to the "system bios" section then "Integrated Devices".  Disable "Integrated RAID Controller" so the HBA330 will go away and let you finish the install.  You can turn it back on later if you like.
