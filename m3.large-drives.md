# Removing the extra drive for Cloudbuilder

* Disable the HBA330 to get through the VCF Management Domain deploy

* Use the SOS console to access your Metal host and get into the BIOS
  * https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/resilience-recovery/serial-over-ssh/

* Reboot the instance and wait for the POST screen then hit F2 to get into the BIOS
  * Go to the "system bios" section then "Integrated Devices"
  * Disable "Integrated RAID Controller"
    * This will disable the HBA330 and let you complete the CloudBuilder install
    * You can turn it back on later if you like.
